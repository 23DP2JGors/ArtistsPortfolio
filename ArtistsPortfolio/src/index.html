                <h2>A master of many arts</h2>
                <p>Leonardo da Vinci was not just a painter — he was a sculptor, architect,
                    musician, scientist, mathematician, engineer, inventor, and writer. His
                    masterpieces like the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper remain among the most
                    famous paintings in history. Da Vinci's unique ability to blend art with
                    science created works that continue to inspire millions around the world.</p>

                <h2>Inventor ahead of his time</h2>
                <p>Leonardo's notebooks reveal thousands of pages filled with sketches and
                    ideas for inventions that were centuries ahead of their time. He designed
                    flying machines, armored vehicles, submarines, and parachutes long before
                    technology could make them real. His curious mind never stopped exploring,
                    making him one of history's greatest visionaries and innovators.</p>
