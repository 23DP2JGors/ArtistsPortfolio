                <li>Leonardo was ambidextrous, able to write with one hand and draw with the other simultaneously.
                </li>
                <li>He wrote his notes in mirror script, which can only be read correctly when reflected in a
                    mirror.
                </li>
                <li>Leonardo was a vegetarian and had a deep love for animals, often buying caged birds just to set
                    them

                <li>He had an extraordinary memory and could recall entire books and images in great detail.</li>
                <li>Leonardo's "Mona Lisa" has no eyebrows; it was common during the Renaissance to shave them off.

                    <h2>A master of many arts</h2>
                    <p>Leonardo da Vinci was not just a painter — he was a sculptor, architect,
                        musician, scientist, mathematician, engineer, inventor, and writer. His
                        masterpieces like the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper remain among the most
                        famous paintings in history. Da Vinci's unique ability to blend art with
                        science created works that continue to inspire millions around the world.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Inventor ahead of his time</h2>
                    <p>Leonardo's notebooks reveal thousands of pages filled with sketches and
                        ideas for inventions that were centuries ahead of their time. He designed
                        flying machines, armored vehicles, submarines, and parachutes long before
                        technology could make them real. His curious mind never stopped exploring,
                        making him one of history's greatest visionaries and innovators.</p>
